**Sunrise/Sunset and NASA Satelite Image**

I wanted to learn and was pleasantly surpised to find it is extremely similar to C#. Just different libraries since we are not using the .NET Framework.

This Java code defines a simple backend service called `sunriseSunsetBackend`, which fetches sunrise and sunset times based on latitude and longitude. It makes HTTP GET requests and uses a 3rd party package Google's Gson library for JSON parsing.

4. **NASA Satelite Image** :: I then added a NASA API so we can download a Satelite image

**Docker**
docker build -t sunrise-sunset-backend .
 
**SprintBoot**
mvn spring-boot:run
This is how we make the Controllers just like in .NET WebAPI
